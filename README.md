# [**W3 Recipes**](https://gazzaj.github.io/CI-MS2-Discover-Kefalonia/)


As a keen cook, I love to try new recipes, but equally as a regular cook it can sometimes be difficult to think of new recipes to try which keep the whole family happy. Thus I 
thought it would be interesting to put a bit of a spin on the typical recipe database and attempt to get a recipe for as many countries in the world as possible, and what better 
way to do this than to get the site users to post their tried and tested favourite recipes.

The primary intention for this website is to provide user with a database of recipes they can search on route to attempting a new recipe, and to also enble those users to upload 
their own recipes to share with other site users. The secondary purpose of the site is to provide the site owner with a means to promote a particular product.

The objective is to achieved the above with a visually appealing, interactive yet intuitiveUX, which provides simple consistent navigation and interaction irrespective of the device. 
Ultimately, I would like this site to be fun, and encourage people:
 - to upload their favourite recipes
 - share the site and encourage their friends to also upload recipes
 - keep track of how popular their recipes are
 - keep track of our progress "filling the map"

### **The 5 Planes of UX** <a name="planes"></a>
The five planes provide a framework for discussing user experience.

#### **Strategy**  


#### **Scope**  


##### Functional Requirements


##### Content Requirements






#### **Structure**  


##### Interaction Design


##### Information Design



#### **Skeleton** 


##### Interface Design


##### Navigation Design




##### Information Design



#### Wireframes <a name="wireframes"></a>
Wireframes for the original design concepts were created using Balsamiq.
##### Home Page
The landing page has no function other than to look enticing and to direct users to explore further.
The bulk of the website is incorporated on the main Explore/Discover page which houses the Google Map

![Landing Page](https://github.com/GazzaJ/CI-MS2-Discover-Kefalonia/blob/master/readme-img/landing-page.png "Landing Page Wireframe")

##### Main Recipe Page
The Map page is the focal point for the website, combining interactive elements with Google map functionality. Clicking category buttons will drop Google Map markers on the Map;
 when each marker is clicked, information displays on the left-hand pane. This will include specific location image and information.

### **Functionality Testing** <a name="functionality-testing"></a>
The following table captures the functional testing performed on the website to ensure it works as desired. I have tested on the listed browsers only using Windows version 
1909 (OS Build 18363.1256), and have not conducted any backward compatibility testing in older browser versions.

|023           |   | |  |  |  |

The philosophy I have used throughout this build is to code, review and test each part of the website as I progressed, relying heavily on Google Dev tools throughout, 
for first pass testing.

- [CSS Auto Prefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) - CSS file checked 
- Mobile Friendly Test - [PASS](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly?id=8jZoJWUliCuw3Bdmly-IwA)
- README.md file spelling checked by copying and pasting the text into word.


### **Usability Testing** <a name="usability-testing"></a>"
I requested fellow CI students and former colleagues to test the website to gather their feedback on the User Experience and Interactivity. What follows are the comments I 
received in return:


### **Responsiveness Testing** <a name="responsiveness-testing"></a>
I have conducted continuous responsiveness testing, right up to the final submission, to ensure the website functions on different devices and in both portrait and landscape orientation, using:
 - Google Devtools
![Responsiveness](https://github.com/GazzaJ/CI-MS2-Discover-Kefalonia/blob/master/readme-img/poi-info.jpg "Website Responsiveness")

## **Bugs and Issues** <a name="bugs"></a>
- The contact form not connecting with EmailJS.

This has been an on / off occurrence ever since I have completed the Contact form. The Devtools Console didn't appear to be displaying any errors; however, on closer inspection an error did flash up but was immediately cleared. I had to video the Console while clicking submit to catch the error.
Research on Stackoverflow confirmed this was likely linked to:
   - The form clearing itself on "Submit"
I subsequently traced this to: 
   - My Javascript code for EmailJS
![EmailJS Error](https://github.com/GazzaJ/CI-MS2-Discover-Kefalonia/blob/master/readme-img/emailjs-error.jpg "EmailJS Error")

I was originally using the code provided in the EmailJS documentation, but this resulted in similar errors. I subsequently adapted the CI Code, from the EMail JS walk through, combined with the Email JS code to try and solve the error.
The solution was to use the Email JS code, but to add **onsubmit = "return false;"** to the Form Tag.
![Console Success](https://github.com/GazzaJ/CI-MS2-Discover-Kefalonia/blob/master/readme-img/emailjs-success.jpg "Console Success")

![Email JS Status 200](https://github.com/GazzaJ/CI-MS2-Discover-Kefalonia/blob/master/readme-img/emailjs-status200.png "Email JS Status 200")

![Gmail Confirmation](https://github.com/GazzaJ/CI-MS2-Discover-Kefalonia/blob/master/readme-img/emailjs-confirm.png "Gmail Confirmation")

-  Devtools Scrolling from information section onto the map is disjointed.
When inspecting the website on Google Devtools it takes a second or two for the page to transition/scroll between the Information pane and the map.
I believe this to be the result of the overflow: auto style I have applied to the poi-text div for mobile devices and is confined to Devtools functionality. This delay DOES NOT occur on actual mobile devices. There is a stop as the text finishes scrolling and the map scrolls as you continue to scroll. The double scroll bars are visible on actual devices, but can be seen on this Responsiveness test.

## **Deployment** <a name="deployment"></a>
All of the files necessary to run this website have been stored in a GitHub repository. If you would like to work on your own version of this site or use it as a template for 
your own work, you have the option to either fork, or make a clone of the original repo.

### **Forking the GitHub Repository**
By forking the GitHub Repository you can make a copy of the original repository on your GitHub account, which enables you to view and/or make your own changes without affecting 
the original repository. This can be achieved using the following steps...

- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
- At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
- You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.
### **Making a Local Clone**
- Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
- Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
- To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
- Open Git Bash
- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
- Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

### **Heroku app creation**
As this is a full-stack website it has been deployed to Heroku.com using the following procedure:
- Log in to Heroku.com
- From the Dashboard, select the "New" button on the Top-Right of the screen
  - Select "Create new app" 
- Insert your app name
  - Heroku will let you know whether your chosen name is available
- Select the most appropriate region for your location
- Click the "Create app" button

### **Heroku Deployment**
The above steps will automatically bring you to the "Deploy" tab of your new app
 1. In the "Deployment Method" section select Github
 Once selected a Connect to GitHub section will display below
 2. Ensure your profile is displayed
    - If not type in your GitHub username
 3. Search for, and select the Repo corresponding to the Heroku app
 4. Click "Connect"

This app uses connec and Heroku requires these in order for the website to function as desired. To do this you need to set the Config Vars
 - Under the "Settings" tab, in the Config Vars section select the "Reveal Config Vars" button
This will reveal a form for inputting the key and value pairs necessary to connect to the app. The

|  KEY  |  VALUE  |
|:-----:|:-------:|
|   IP  | 0.0.0.0 |
|  PORT |  5000   |
| SECRET KEY | Randomly Generated Fort Knox Key|
| MONGO_URI | Your unique MongoDB URI |
| MONGO_DBNAME | Your unique Mongo DB name |

The above Mongo_URI variable can be found in the appropriate Mongo DB Project under Cluster by selecting "Connect"
 1. Select "Clusters"
 2. Select "Connect"
 3. Select "Connect your application"
 4. Choose your Driver and Version
   - Remembering to substitute in your own DBNAME and Password
 5. Copy your connection string

### **Enabling Automatic Deployment**
 - Select the Heroku "Deploy" tab
 - In the "Automatic deploys" section select the branch you wish to use
 
There is no difference between the developed version and that deployed on Heroku
